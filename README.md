* Renders 3D scenes using ray tracing.
* Supports spheres, planes, triangles.
* Materials: Diffuse, Emissive, Metallic, Refractive.

## HOW IT WORKS?

Rays are generated from a virtual camera. Each ray is traced into the 3D scene. If it hits an object, its material defines the behavior:

- Diffuse: scattered reflection
- Metallic: specular reflection
- Transmission: refracted rays
- Emissive: light emission

The process recurses with new rays (path tracing).
Color contributions accumulate per pixel.
Final image is saved as a png file.


## HOW TO RENDER IMAGES ?

You can create your own 3D models using Blender or any other 3D modelling software and import them into Tinge using the `.obj` format. Follow the steps below:

1. Model in Blender

- Design your 3D object in Blender (e.g., cube, stacked shapes, etc.).
- Assign clear names to objects for easier identification in the `.obj` file.

2. Export as `.obj`

In Blender:

1. Select the object(s) you want to export.
2. Go to `File → Export → Wavefront (.obj)`
3. Use these recommended export settings:
   - Selection Only** 
   - Include Normals**
   - Objects as OBJ Objects**

This will generate:
- `your_model.obj` — contains your model’s vertex positions, normals, and faces.

3. Add the Model to Your Tinge Project

* Place your `.obj` file inside the Tinge folder
* Modify the code in the file scene_generator.cpp to set up the scene that you wish to render


## ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

- CMake version 3.10 or higher
- A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS

## BUILDING TINGE

* Create the build directory
```
mkdir build
```

* navigate to the buid directory
```
cd build
```

* Run CMake to configure the project
```
cmake ..
```

* Build the project using make
```
make .
```

* Run the program after the build is completed, the rendered image will be written into the bin folder
