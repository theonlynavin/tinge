- Concepts of pinhole cameras, ray generation, and ray-shape intersections (sphere, plane, triangle) were taught
- It was decided that Navin will be providing a common Vec3, Vec4, Mat3, Mat4 implemenetation to be used by all the DCs
- The following reading tasks were given:
    - [Pinhole Camera](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/3d-viewing-pinhole-camera/how-pinhole-camera-works-part-1.html)
    - [Möller–Trumbore Intersection Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ller%E2%80%93Trumbore_intersection_algorithm)
- A [programming assignment](../tasks/week3.pdf) which involves the creation of a Camera class and Shape classes was given to DCs
